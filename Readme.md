# ðŸ§  ML-MULTI-ALGO: Tree-Based Models with SHAP Interpretation

This project trains multiple **tree-based machine learning models** (Decision Trees, Random Forests, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) for **classification and regression**, and uses **SHAP** to interpret model predictions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Automated training and cross-validation across multiple models
- GPU acceleration for XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost
- SHAP explainability (global + per-class feature importance)
- Force plots saved as PNGs for interpretability
